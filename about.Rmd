## About Me
My name is **Jackson Roe**, and I am a rising senior attending Dublin Coffman High School. 

## About the Project
*March Madness: How to pick a perfect bracket*  
This project was designed to analyze every march madness bracket since the 1985 expansion to a 64-team tournament, with the goal of providing people with an easy to understand blueprint of how to pick the best bracket possible.

### Goals
* Effectively analyze past March Madness Tournaments
  + It may be hard to create complex variables with the simple dataset I have found.
* Provide useful data to people about March Madness
